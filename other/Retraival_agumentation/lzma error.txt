Briefly, pip install lzma will not work, do it instead:

pip install backports.lzma
and go to your python directory:

cd /usr/local/lib/python3.8
and you will modify your lzma.py file. I could only do this with higher permission level, so I did

sudo nano lzma.py
In the beginning, there are two lines

from _lzma import *
from _lzma import _encode_filter_properties, _decode_filter_properties
Modify them to

from backports.lzma import *
from backports.lzma import _encode_filter_properties, _decode_filter_properties
and save and close the file. Boltztrap2 may work now.
